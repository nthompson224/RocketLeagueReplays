# RocketLeagueReplays

## Using React and Supabase

## A webapp that is used as an open-source database for Rocket League .replay files for user friendly upload, filter and search.
## This app also allows user to upload mp4 files of clipped gameplay to also share among users.

### This app is meant to be built on to include other games such as: Fortnite, League of Legends, etc.

# For use:
## You must have a docker running to deploy this project along with the latest npm version
### This is until I have the resources to deploy this website.
